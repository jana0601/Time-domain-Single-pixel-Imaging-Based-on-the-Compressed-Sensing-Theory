# Time-domain-Single-pixel-Imaging-Based-on-the-Compressed-Sensing-Theory

## Simulation in Matlab
The hole system simulated in Matlab.

## Sensing basis
In sensing basis folder, I provided 6 kind of sensing matrix.

## Sparse basis
In sparse basis folder, I provided 2 kind of sparse matrix--discrete cosine transform matrix and wavelet transform, which consists of most kinds of wavelet basis.
